I have been preparing all day for this round of mystery can.  After yesterday's beets (ugh) I wanted to make sure I am hungry enough to devour anything that comes my way, so I have eaten nothing but a few sunflower seeds and a piece of toast all day.  I am ready to go!  Also, today is a special mystery can because my main course is leftover from another round.  I took the other half of the can of tomatoes and made some tomato soup.  Let's see how that goes with whatever I end up with.  Chris arrived home with some vegan pizza and salad to eat with his mystery can.  Let round 3 begin!


<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc301.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Chris opted to go first.  His can had almost no sound at all when he shook it.</p>



<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc302.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">According to Wikipedia, sauerkraut is an extremely healthy food. It is an excellent source of vitamin C, lactobacilli, and other nutrients.  That is good news for Chris, because he has to eat half a can of it.</p>



<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc303.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In 1776, Captain James Cook was awarded the Copley Medal for demonstrating that sauerkraut could be used to allay scurvy in British crews on long sea voyages.  Chris:  "This tastes like nail polish remover."</p>



<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc304.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My turn!</p>



<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc305.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A clear liquid emerges from the can as I open it.</p>



<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc306.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What on earth is this??</p>



<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc308.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I have no idea what this is.  It smells starchy?  Chris cut out the directions for me which said to warm it up, so that's what I did.  Chris said it is some sort of corn or something.</p>



<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc309.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Corn is generally pretty good.  Let's see how this is.</p>



<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc310.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hmmm...</p>



<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc311.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ok, it's not too bad, but not great either.  Has kind of a weird texture, but tastes like...corn soaked in water.  It turns out to be this stuff called hominy...which is pretty much corn soaked in water...  It's alright.  Could be worse!  I won't have much trouble eating it though.</p>



<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc312.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">...unlike Chris.  "Seriously, this tastes like acetone.  What kind of sauerkraut is this?"</p>



<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc313.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hooray for mystery can!</p>


Alright, I don't know if you are supposed to keep score in mystery can or not, but I would say that if there is a score it would be me: 2, Chris: 1.  Mystery can round 4 is tomorrow!
