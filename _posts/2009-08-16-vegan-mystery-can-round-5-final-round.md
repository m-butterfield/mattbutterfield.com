Today is the final day of mystery can.  It has been quite an adventure.  Chris had a hankering for some bbq vegan rib things (which are delicious), so we microwaved some of those up and had them with some rice for our last main course of mystery can.  What does the last day have in store for us?  Will the gods of mystery can have mercy on my taste buds, or is the worst can saved for last?  The only way to know is to press on to round 5!

<p style="text-align: center;">Look at those ribs.  They were delicious.  But what about Chris's last can, is that also delicious?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I do not feel bad about this.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Time to see what my final punishment is.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">It's spinach.  I hate spinach.  I'm not even convinced that it is food.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I thought "Maybe if I just mix some in with my rice it won't be too bad."  I was wrong.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This is as far as I got before wanting to throw up.  I am a ween, I know.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Chris made it a little farther.</p>

Well, that concludes our mystery can adventure.  Here are my thoughts about mystery can:
1.  There was no winner of mystery can.  The only winning move in mystery can is not to play.
2.  I can't imagine doing this for ten days.
3.  Eating things cold right out of a can is sometimes not so bad, sometimes gut wrenchingly awful.
4.  I am a wuss when it comes to eating food I don't like, therefore...
5.  I am never doing this again.  Goodnight.
