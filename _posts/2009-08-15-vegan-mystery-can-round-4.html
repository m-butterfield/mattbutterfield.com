I bet you all thought that because today is Saturday, we would be taking a day off from mystery can.  Well you are in for a treat.  Here at mystery can, there is no such thing as a day off.  That's right, it's time for mystery can round 4.  Are you ready for this?  I bet you aren't.  Here we go anyways.

<p style="text-align: center;">I prepared some falafel for us to eat as the main course tonight with the new deep fryer that was a near disaster, but I pulled it together so mystery can could go on.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">What is in store for me tonight?  More stuff floating in liquid...</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Whoa.  Is this...fruit cocktail?!?!?  Awesome!  A nice treat.  Whew.</p>




<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc404.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Turned out to be a nice little meal.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Chris slowly and cautiously opened his can, glaring at me after having to eat half a can of sauerkraut yesterday.</p>




<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc406.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Refried beans!</p>




<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc407.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">mmmmmm...</p>




<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc408.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Not too bad.  Today seems to be a tame day for mystery can</p>




<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc409.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But wait...what's this?  I am an eating machine!  OM NOM NOM NOM!!!</p>




<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i115/fireparagon/mc410.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Wow.  For the first time someone has eaten the entire contents of their mystery can in one sitting!!!  *pats self on back*  Whew!</p>



Some may argue that today was not an exciting day for mystery can.  Let me tell you, as one of the people who actually has to eat this stuff, today was very exciting.  A wonderful, delicious meal is a nice treat.  However, tomorrow is the last day for vegan mystery can, and I have a feeling it won't be so easy for either of us...
