Yesterday we went to see the Hunter S. Thompson documentary at the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor.  It was excellent!  Easily the awesomest biographical documentary I've seen in a long time.  But, as LeVar Burton always said while hosting Reading Rainbow: Don't take my word for it!  I am no movie critic, go see it yourself.  After the movie and a quick stop in Ypsilanti (worst town ever btw, but worth the stop), we headed back to my house where things got...a little crazy (and fun).  Today I've just been cleaning and sitting around while drinking wine and iced tea.  Pretty good times I must say.  Also I went on a bike ride with Chris to a field!  That's right, a field.  Geez, where will I go next?!  I'm crazy!
